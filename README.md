## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Learning Objective

This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:
Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub, Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles, Implement advanced security measures for API development, Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment, Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively, Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. This includes creating APIs, integrating with databases, ensuring scalability, and optimizing performance.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the database environment, ensuring data integrity, security, and backup procedures. Responsible for database design, performance tuning, and troubleshooting.

### Frontend Developer
Implements the user interface and ensures a seamless user experience. They work closely with backend developers to integrate APIs and create responsive, accessible, and efficient designs.

### Project Manager
Coordinates the entire development process, manages timelines, assigns tasks, and ensures that deliverables meet the project requirements.

### QA Engineer
Tests the application to identify bugs, performance issues, and usability problems. Ensures that the final product meets quality standards before release.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure management. Ensures smooth integration between development and operations teams.

## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It provides tools for creating RESTful APIs, handling authentication, and managing server-side logic.

### PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and manage application data with high reliability and performance.

### GraphQL
An API query language that allows clients to request specific data, reducing over-fetching and improving performance compared to traditional REST APIs.

### Docker
A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments (development, staging, and production).

### Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching and managing sessions to improve application performance.

### Nginx
A web server and reverse proxy used to handle client requests, serve static files, and balance traffic across application instances.

## Database Design

  - `rating` (Integer)
  - `comment` (Text)
- **Relationship:** A review is created by a user for a specific property.

#### 5. Payments
- **Fields:** 
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
  - `amount` (Decimal)
  - `status` (Enum: pending, completed, failed)
  - `payment_date` (DateTime)
- **Relationship:** A payment is associated with a single booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Role-based access (guest, host, admin) ensures that users have appropriate permissions for their activities on the platform.

### Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, and remove properties. Each property includes details such as title, description, price, images, and location to attract potential guests.

### Booking System
Enables guests to search for properties, check availability, and make reservations. It ensures date validation, pricing calculations, and prevents double bookings.

### Review System
Provides a platform for guests to leave ratings and comments about their stays. Reviews help build trust and guide other users in making informed decisions.

### Payment Integration
Handles secure transactions for property bookings. Supports multiple payment statuses (pending, completed, failed) and maintains transaction history.

### Search & Filtering
Allows users to find properties quickly using filters such as location, price range, and availability dates. Improves the user experience by reducing search time.

### Admin Dashboard
Gives administrators control over users, properties, and bookings. Includes analytics and monitoring tools to ensure smooth platform operations.

## API Security

### Authentication
Implements secure login and session management using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2. This ensures that only verified users can access protected endpoints.

### Authorization
Uses role-based access control (RBAC) to determine what resources a user can access based on their role (guest, host, admin). Prevents unauthorized actions such as editing another userâ€™s property.

### Data Encryption
Encrypts sensitive data (passwords, payment details) both in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) and at rest. Protects user information from being intercepted or leaked.

### Rate Limiting & Throttling
Restricts the number of API requests per user/IP to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Helps maintain performance and availability of the system.

### Input Validation & Sanitization
Ensures all incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### Importance of Security
- **Protecting User Data:** Safeguards personal information, login credentials, and sensitive booking details.
- **Securing Payments:** Prevents fraud and unauthorized transactions by using encrypted and verified payment gateways.
- **Ensuring Platform Integrity:** Protects the application from malicious activities and ensures user trust.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices that automate the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications. CI ensures that code is continuously built and tested, while CD automates the deployment process to staging or production environments.

### Importance for the Project
- **Faster Development:** Automates testing and deployment to reduce manual work.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Runs automated tests for every commit to catch bugs early.
- **Reliable Releases:** Ensures consistent builds across all environments, minimizing errors during deployment.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows such as running tests and deploying applications directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker:** Creates containerized environments for consistent builds and deployments.
- **Jenkins (Optional):** A flexible CI/CD server that can be used for more complex workflows.
